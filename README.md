# line-fast-space-01

This repository contains code and resources for the SPACE-01 board, including libraries, drivers, and example programs.

## Key Features & Benefits

*   Provides necessary libraries and drivers for the SPACE-01 board.
*   Includes example Arduino sketches for various functionalities like motor control, PID control, and sensor integration.
*   Offers resources for setting up and using the SPACE-01 board with Arduino.

## Prerequisites & Dependencies

*   Arduino IDE
*   SPACE-01 Board
*   CH341SER driver (if required)
*   light_CD74HC4067 library
*   SPACE01 library

## Installation & Setup Instructions

### Installing Libraries

1.  Navigate to the `installation/library` folder.
2.  There should be two ZIP files named `SPACE01.zip` and `light_CD74HC4067.zip`.
3.  In the Arduino IDE, go to `Sketch > Include Library > Add .ZIP Library...`
4.  Select both `SPACE01.zip` and `light_CD74HC4067.zip` and click "Open".
5.  The libraries are now installed.

### Installing Drivers (if needed)

1.  Connect the SPACE-01 board to your computer via USB.
2.  Navigate to the `installation/driver` folder.
3.  Locate the `CH341SER.EXE` file.
4.  Right-click on `CH341SER.EXE` and select "Run as administrator".
5.  Click "Install".
6.  After installation, restart your computer.

## Usage Examples & API Documentation

Example Arduino sketches are located in the `sopon` and `unkown` directories.  Here's a brief overview:

*   **`sopon` Directory:**
    *   `Motor.ino`: Example code for controlling motors.
    *   `PIDcontrol.ino`: Example code for PID control implementation.
    *   `Sensor.ino`: Example code for reading sensor data.
    *   `SetupRobot.ino`: Example code for configuring robot settings.
    *   `Turn.ino`: Example code for robot turning functionality.
    *   `sopon.ino`:  Main sketch example combining various functionalities.

*   **`unkown` Directory:**
    *   Contains two subdirectories, `2000` and `3000`, each with `*.ino`, `PID.ino`, `Sensor.ino`, and `Turn.ino` examples, potentially representing different robot or hardware configurations.

**Detailed API Documentation:** Specific API documentation for the SPACE01 and light_CD74HC4067 libraries are not included in this repository. Consult the respective library documentation if available.

## Configuration Options

Configuration options depend on the specific Arduino sketch being used. Refer to the comments and code within each `*.ino` file for details on configurable parameters such as:

*   Motor control parameters (e.g., speed, direction).
*   PID control gains (Kp, Ki, Kd).
*   Sensor calibration values.
*   Robot-specific settings (e.g., wheel diameter, wheelbase).
